# Math-Eucation-Project

<h1>Introduction</h1>



Math-Eucation-Project is an educational application for mathematics. The application follows the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architecture pattern, and has been designed using Figma. Application works by API Server. 
The application contains books and quizzes for grades one to six, with different topics for each grade. The application is built using Swift and Xcode.

<h2>Features</h2>

The Math-Eucation-Project application has the following features:</br>

A home screen with options to select grades from one to six.</br>
A book screen that displays the list of books available for the selected grade.</br>
A topic screen that displays the list of topics for the selected book.</br>
A quiz screen that displays a quiz after a topic is completed.</br>
A quiz result screen that displays the score and the correct answers for the quiz.</br>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

The Math-Eucation-Project application follows the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture pattern. The different components of the application are:</br>

Model: The data model consists of the different books, topics, and quizzes.</br>
View: The user interface of the application is implemented using storyboards and view controllers.</br>
Presenter: The logic of the application is implemented in the presenters.</br>
The application uses the delegation pattern to communicate between view controllers and presenters.</br>
